# GraphQL Server Starter for Vercel

A minimalistic yet versatile GraphQL server starter designed to streamline the development of GraphQL-powered applications. This project is built with scalability and simplicity in mind, making it suitable for side hustles, educational purposes, or full-fledged production-grade applications.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic GraphQL API**
   - Users have their own dynamic GraphQL endpoints at `/username/graphql`.
   - Each user endpoint is protected with **authorization**, ensuring privacy and security. Unauthorized access attempts are denied.

### 2. **Global GraphQL Endpoint**
   - Publicly accessible at `/graphql` without restrictions.
   - Ideal for shared resources or testing purposes.

### 3. **Dictionary Query Functionality**
   - Enables users to search for word meanings.
   - Utilizes web scraping techniques to fetch dictionary data.
   - Great for developers new to web scrapingâ€”learn foundational techniques from the codebase.

### 4. **Customizable GraphQL Queries**
   - The power of GraphQL allows users to:
     - Fetch only the fields they need.
     - Control how the data is displayed and accessed.
   - Supports resource queries like `users` and `posts`, demonstrating relational data handling.

## Example Queries

### Dictionary Query
Fetch the meaning of a word:
```graphql
query {
  dictionary(word: "example") {
    word
    meaning
  }
}
```

### User Query
Fetch user details and their posts:
```graphql
query {
  user(username: "emilys") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

### Post Query
Fetch all posts:
```graphql
query {
  posts {
    title
    author {
      username
      email
    }
  }
}
```

## Security and Authorization

- Public endpoints (`/graphql`) are accessible without restrictions.
- Private endpoints (`/username/graphql`) require a valid authorization token.
- Unauthorized attempts to access protected resources are denied with an appropriate error message.
